This project is a first person shooter survival game developed in C# using the Unity game engine. 
While the project is not yet complete, it has taught me scripting in C# language and has greatly influenced my fluency in the language.
The game is built for Windows and MacOS platform but can be easily ported to Android/iOS as well as Playstation/Xbox.
